                    <h3>MIX</h3>
                    <p>The first step is to study the DJs who you respect, which is already what you're doing, so that's great. 
                        I often think good mixing is a bit like being a magician;
                        You are aiming to fool "most of the people, most of the time", and of course as the guy pulling the tricks, you're never going to fool yourself! 
                        So I guess what I'm saying is don't be too hard on yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having said that, there are tricks you can employ.
                        My main tip right now is to stop trying to do the perfect mix (make the actual point where the two songs join perfect), and start thinking about the perfect way to complement both songs. If they are choppy, changing songs, then a choppy mix can be the right thing to do!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mixing at breaks often helps, as does matching similar sonic elements (white noise, basslines) . 
                        Finally, dropping in a new track on an instantly recognisable riff can win the crowd before they start thinking about BPM or style change.
                        Think "the right tracks, mixed simply" rather than big, grandiose, complex mixes for the sake of it.
                        As I say, we're spending many weeks on filming a load of videos to go deeper into this, but I am sure in the meantime many of our readers will want to share some of their personal advice with you as well, as I know lots of folk struggle with the same question.
