                    <h3>LIVE</h3>
                        <p>A DJ may have some live production going on during their set, especially in the past several years with all the new technology that is coming out all the time.
                           The line between a Live Set and a DJ Set has been getting harder to distinguish. With the new STEM players someone that is doing something that looks like a DJ would do is really doing much more than beatmatching.
                           Because some people don't know what it means, and some think it's something else the term has gotten less meaningful and can mean just about anything if there is a living person involved in the set.

                           Live can also mean a mix was recorded at an attended venue, like a club or something, mixed live. 
                           Live and Set are two words, but who knew humanity would feel so inconvenienced with using two words when one might get the point across.

                           If you see gear that you do not know the purpose of and do not see CD players or a DJ mixer, or something that looks like DJ software, it is probably live. 
                           Many of the <a href="https://boilerroom.tv/" style="text-decoration:none" target=_blank>Boiler Room</a> sets are a combination of live and DJ.
